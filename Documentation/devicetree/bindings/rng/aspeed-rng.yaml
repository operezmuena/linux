description: |
  The HRNG on the AST2400/AST2500/AST2600 SOCs from AspeedTech  uses four Ring
  Oscillators working together to generate a stream of random bits that can be
  read by the platform via a 32bit data register every one microsecond.
  All the platform has to do is to provide to the driver the 'quality' entropy
  value, the  'mode' in which the combining  ROs will generate the  stream  of
  random bits and, the 'period' value that is used as a wait-time between reads
  from the 32bit data register.


properties:
  compatible:
    oneOf:
      - items:
          - enum:
              - aspeed,ast2400-rng
              - aspeed,ast2500-rng
              - aspeed,ast2600-rng


  reg:
    description:
      Base address and length of the register set of this block.
      Currently 'reg' must be eight bytes wide and 32-bit aligned.

    maxItems: 1


  period:
    description:
      Wait time in microseconds to be used between reads.
      The RNG on these Aspeed SOCs generates 32bit of random data
      every one microsecond. Choose between 1 and n microseconds.

    maxItems: 1


  mode:
    description:
      One of the eight modes in which the four internal ROs (Ring
      Oscillators)  are combined to generate a stream  of random
      bits. The default mode is seven which is the default method
      of combining RO random bits on these Aspeed SOCs.

    maxItems: 1


  quality:
    description:
      Estimated number of bits of entropy per 1024 bits read from
      the RNG.  Note that the default quality is zero which stops
      this HRNG from automatically filling the kernel's entropy
      pool with data.

    maxItems: 1
